# Insight Interceptor

## Overview

**Insight Interceptor** is an advanced Python tool designed to monitor and analyze user sentiment on X (formerly Twitter) using the OpenAI API. By leveraging AI-driven sentiment analysis and topic categorization, Insight Interceptor enables users to proactively respond to negative sentiment, gain insights into trending topics, and visualize sentiment distribution across a wide array of tweets. This tool is particularly valuable for businesses, social media managers, researchers, and analysts who require real-time sentiment tracking and comprehensive analysis.

## Key Features

- **Sentiment Analysis**: The tool analyzes the sentiment of each tweet using the OpenAI API, classifying them as positive, neutral, or negative. This helps in understanding public opinion and identifying potential issues early.
  
- **Topic Categorization**: Tweets are automatically categorized into relevant topics, allowing users to focus on specific areas of concern or interest. This feature is essential for identifying trends and understanding the context behind sentiments.

- **Alert System**: Insight Interceptor includes an alert mechanism that triggers notifications for tweets with negative sentiment, enabling timely interventions and response strategies.

- **Data Visualization**: The tool provides basic visualization capabilities to present the distribution of sentiments in a clear and understandable format, making it easier to derive actionable insights.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Python 3.7 or higher**: Make sure Python is installed on your machine.
- **OpenAI API Key**: You'll need an API key from OpenAI, which you can obtain by signing up on their website.
- **Twitter API Keys**: Access to the Twitter API requires consumer keys, access tokens, and secrets, all of which can be obtained by creating a developer account on Twitter.

## Installation

To set up the Insight Interceptor on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/insight-interceptor.git
   cd insight-interceptor
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Install the required Python packages by running the following command:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   The `requirements.txt` file includes all necessary libraries such as `openai`, `tweepy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `scikit-learn`.

3. **Configure API Keys**

   Set up your OpenAI and Twitter API keys by adding them to your environment variables or directly in the script configuration:

   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-openai-api-key'
   export TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY='your-consumer-key'
   export TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET='your-consumer-secret'
   export TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN='your-access-token'
   export TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET='your-access-token-secret'
   ```

## Usage

To run the Insight Interceptor and start monitoring tweets, follow these steps:

1. **Execute the Script**

   Run the main Python script:

   ```bash
   python insight_interceptor.py
   ```

2. **Monitor Sentiment Analysis**

   The tool will fetch recent tweets based on the configured keywords, analyze their sentiment, and categorize them into relevant topics. It will also trigger alerts if any negative sentiment is detected, allowing you to take immediate action.

3. **Visualize the Results**

   After the analysis, use the built-in visualization functions to generate bar charts or other graphical representations of the sentiment distribution. This helps in better understanding the overall mood and trends in the data.

4. **Explore Further**

   Dive deeper into the data by adjusting the search parameters, refining the sentiment analysis model, or extending the tool with additional features like real-time monitoring or advanced analytics.

## Example Use Cases

- **Brand Monitoring**: Companies can use Insight Interceptor to monitor what customers are saying about their products or services in real-time, helping them to respond to negative feedback promptly.
  
- **Crisis Management**: During a PR crisis, this tool can help identify the main topics of concern and gauge public sentiment, enabling quick and informed decision-making.
  
- **Market Research**: Researchers can categorize and analyze large volumes of tweets to understand public opinion on various topics, trends, and events.

## Future Enhancements

We plan to extend the capabilities of Insight Interceptor by adding the following features:

- **Real-Time Sentiment Analysis**: Implementing a streaming data pipeline to continuously monitor sentiment in real-time.
  
- **Comprehensive Dashboard**: Building an interactive dashboard using tools like Dash or Streamlit to provide a more user-friendly interface and richer data visualizations.

- **Advanced Sentiment Metrics**: Introducing more granular sentiment metrics and deeper analytical insights to better understand the nuances of public opinion.
